# Federal Engagement Orchestrator - Agent Instructions

*Complete behavioral guidelines for processing transcripts and managing engagement lifecycle*

## Core Operating Principles

### 1. Multi-Phase System
This skill handles **four distinct phases**:
- **Planning**: Process planning call → Generate agenda + tasks
- **Closeout**: Process engagement → Extract closeout data → Fill CEHub
- **Learning**: Query knowledge graph → Provide insights and patterns
- **Prospecting**: Generate sample agendas → Ground on successful patterns

### 2. Iterative Review (Planning & Closeout)
**NEVER auto-generate**. Always:
1. **Analyze** → Extract information
2. **Preview** → Show what was found
3. **Confirm** → User validates
4. **Refine** → Update based on feedback
5. **Generate** → Create files after approval

### 3. Knowledge Graph Integration
**ALWAYS store AND query**:
- Store every engagement in knowledge graph
- Query past engagements for grounding
- Learn patterns over time
- Provide data-driven recommendations

---

## Phase 1: Planning Call Processing

### Input Recognition
Trigger phrases:
- "Process planning call"
- "Generate agenda for [customer]"
- "Planning transcript for [customer]"

### Extraction Requirements

**Customer/Agency Name** (CRITICAL RULE):
- MUST be external organization
- NEVER "Microsoft", "Microsoft Innovation Hub", or internal names
- Examples: ✅ "ATF BATS" ❌ "Microsoft"

**Engagement Date**:
- Extract from transcript if mentioned
- Parse formats: "January 15", "01/15/2026", "next Friday"
- Convert to YYYY-MM-DD
- If not in transcript, ask user

**Engagement Type**:
- Discovery: "discovery", "initial", "kickoff"
- Architecture Review: "architecture", "technical", "design"
- POC: "poc", "proof of concept", "pilot"
- Executive Briefing: "executive", "leadership", "briefing"
- Deep Dive: "deep dive", "detailed", "technical session"

**Topics**:
- Extract from lists, time allocations, discussions
- Capture specific technologies, frameworks, requirements
- Use exact terminology from transcript

**Attendees**:
- Microsoft team members
- Customer team members
- Roles and titles

### Knowledge Graph Query (NEW!)

Before generating agenda, ALWAYS query knowledge graph:

```
1. Search for similar past engagements:
   - Same customer (if exists)
   - Same industry/agency type
   - Same engagement type
   - High success scores (>7)

2. Extract patterns:
   - What topics worked well?
   - What was the typical structure?
   - How long did topics take?
   - What challenges occurred?

3. Ground new agenda on these patterns
```

**Example**:
```
User: "Process FBI discovery planning call"

Claude internal process:
1. Extract: Customer=FBI, Type=Discovery
2. Query knowledge graph:
   - Find similar: DEA, ATF (law enforcement)
   - Find Discovery engagements with success>7
3. Extract patterns:
   - Compliance discussed early (100%)
   - Customer-led discovery works (85%)
   - Concrete demos early build credibility
4. Generate agenda incorporating these patterns
5. Show user what patterns were used
```

### Preview Generation

Show plain text preview including:

```
CUSTOMER: [Extracted name]
DATE: [Extracted or "Please provide"]
TYPE: [Engagement type]

🔍 GROUNDED ON PAST ENGAGEMENTS:
- [Similar engagement 1] (success: X)
- [Similar engagement 2] (success: Y)

COMMON SUCCESS PATTERNS FOUND:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

PROPOSED AGENDA:
[Detailed agenda following patterns]

TASKS TIMELINE:
[All 15 tasks with calculated business day dates]

---
Confirm or correct?
```

### Agenda Generation Rules

**Sequence**:
1. Intro/Goals (15 min)
2. Discovery (60-90 min)
3. Custom topics (variable)
4. Lunch (1 hr for full-day)
5. More topics
6. Next Steps (20-30 min)

**Descriptions**:
- Standard items: Use consistent patterns
- Custom topics: Highly detailed with transcript terminology
- Include success factors from knowledge graph

**Quality Checks**:
✓ Customer = external org (NOT "Microsoft")
✓ Date extracted from transcript
✓ Title specific and transcript-driven
✓ Agenda sequence correct
✓ Descriptions detailed
✓ Business day calculations correct
✓ Patterns from knowledge graph applied

### Knowledge Graph Storage

After user confirms agenda, store:

```python
# Store/update customer
create_entity(
    type="Customer",
    name=customer_name,
    properties={
        "industry": industry,
        "agency_type": agency_type,
        "solution_areas": solution_areas,
        "hub_priorities": hub_priorities
    }
)

# Store engagement (planning phase)
create_entity(
    type="Engagement",
    name=f"{customer_name} - {date}",
    properties={
        "engagement_type": engagement_type,
        "date": date,
        "duration": duration,
        "topics_planned": topics,
        "status": "planned"
    }
)

# Link engagement to customer
create_relation(
    from_entity=engagement,
    to_entity=customer,
    relation_type="conducted_for"
)

# Store each topic
for topic in topics:
    # Create or update topic entity
    # Link to engagement
```

---

## Phase 2: Engagement Closeout Processing

### Input Recognition
Trigger phrases:
- "Process closeout"
- "Process engagement transcript"
- "Fill CEHub for [customer]"
- "Generate closeout for [engagement]"

### Extraction from Engagement Transcript

Extract these fields for CEHub:

**Basic Info** (from planning data if available):
- Customer name
- Engagement title
- Date of session (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS)
- Lead architect (default: "Brendon Colburn")
- Solution areas
- Industry
- Hub motion priorities

**Debrief Section** (analyze transcript):
- **Industry Insights**: New insights about industry/agency
  - Look for: Emerging trends, customer statements about their industry
  - If none: "No major new insights uncovered"

- **What Worked Well**: Success factors from the engagement
  - Look for: Positive reactions, demos that landed, approaches that worked
  - Include: Prep quality, execution highlights, customer engagement
  - Be specific: "Live demo of [X] with customer's actual data"

- **What Didn't Work**: Challenges and learnings
  - Look for: Technical issues, timing problems, missing prerequisites
  - Include: How it could be improved
  - If nothing major: "Minor timing adjustments needed"

**Outcomes Section**:
- **New Opportunities**: New projects/opportunities discovered
  - Look for: Adjacent use cases, expanded scope, new initiatives
  - Be specific about the opportunity

- **Customer Journey**: Next engagements agreed upon
  - Options: POC, Architecture Review, Production, Training, Other
  - Specify which one

- **Next Steps Guidance**: Specific next steps and timeframe
  - Action items with owners
  - Timeline for next engagement
  - Dependencies and prerequisites

- **Outcomes**: What was delivered
  - Use cases defined

...
[all fields]

User can copy/paste into CEHub manually
```

### Knowledge Graph Update

After closeout processing:

```python
# Update engagement with outcomes
add_observations(
    entity=engagement,
    observations=[
        f"Status: completed",
        f"What worked well: {what_worked_well}",
        f"What didn't work: {what_didnt_work}",
        f"New opportunities: {new_opportunities}",
        f"Success indicators: {derived_from_outcomes}"
    ]
)

# Calculate success score (1-10) based on:
# - New opportunities generated
# - Positive outcomes
# - Customer engagement level
# - Next steps clarity
success_score = calculate_success_score(closeout_data)

add_observations(
    entity=engagement,
    observations=[f"Success score: {success_score}"]
)

# Update topic effectiveness
for topic in topics_covered:
    add_observations(
        entity=topic,
        observations=[
            f"Used in {customer_name} ({industry}) - {engagement_type}",
            f"Effectiveness: {rating_from_what_worked}",
            f"Duration: {actual_duration}"
        ]
    )

# Identify patterns
if success_score >= 8:
    # This was a successful engagement
    # Extract what made it successful for pattern recognition
    create_entity(
        type="Pattern",
        name=f"Success pattern: {engagement_type} with {industry}",
        properties={
            "context": f"{industry}, {engagement_type}",
            "key_factors": extract_success_factors(closeout_data),
            "example_engagement": engagement_name
        }
    )
```

   - Filter by success_score > 7
2. Extract topics from successful engagements
3. Calculate:
   - Inclusion rate (% of engagements that used it)
   - Average duration
   - Effectiveness rating
4. Identify anti-patterns (what didn't work)
5. Provide data-driven recommendations
```

**Type 2: Ground new agenda on past success**
```
User: "Generate agenda for [Customer] [Type]"

Claude process:
1. Find similar successful engagements:
   - Same/similar customer if exists
