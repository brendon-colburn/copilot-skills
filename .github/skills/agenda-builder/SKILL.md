name: agenda-builder
description: Creates engagement agendas from planning transcripts or notes. Extracts structured agenda data into JSON format, then renders DOCX using templates. Use when building agendas, processing planning calls, or when user mentions transcripts, Discovery, Architecture Review, POC, Executive Briefing, Deep Dive sessions, or agenda generation.

# Agenda Builder

**Architecture**: Claude analyzes transcript → Creates JSON → Python renders DOCX

Claude does the intelligent extraction. Python just renders the template.

## Workflow

```
AI Agenda Building Process:
- [ ] Analyze planning transcript/notes
- [ ] Extract structured data following AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.MD
- [ ] Create JSON with customer, date, title, summary, agenda_items
- [ ] Show preview to user for confirmation
- [ ] Get user approval/corrections
- [ ] Save JSON to engagement folder
- [ ] Automatically install required Python packages (if not already installed)
- [ ] Call scripts/core.py to render DOCX
- [ ] Update knowledge graph with topics
```

## Step 1: Analyze Transcript (Claude Does This)

Read full planning transcript or qualification notes.

Follow rules from [references/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.MD](references/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.MD):
- **CRITICAL**: `customer` = external org (NEVER "Microsoft")
- Extract specific date if mentioned
- Use transcript terminology for topics/descriptions
- Standard items get standard descriptions
- Custom topics get detailed, transcript-specific descriptions

## Step 2: Extract Structured JSON (Claude Creates This)

Required structure:

```json
{
  "customer": "External Organization Name",
  "date": "Month Day, Year",
  "time": "9:30 AM - 4:00 PM",
  "title": "Specific, Transcript-Driven Title",
  "summary": "Why this session matters (synthesize, don't list items)",
  "primaries": [
    {"name": "Person Name", "role": "Role"}
  ],
  "supporting": [
    {"name": "Person Name", "role": "Role"}  
  ],
  "agenda_items": [
    {
      "time": "9:30 AM - 9:45 AM",
      "owner": "Microsoft",
      "topic": "Introductions & Session Objectives",
      "description": "Brief participant introductions. Overview of session goals and logistics."
    },
    {
      "time": "9:45 AM - 11:00 AM",
      "owner": "Microsoft & Customer",
      "topic": "Discovery: Current State & Challenges",
      "description": "Collaborative discovery of Customer's current environment..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Agenda Item Rules

**Sequence**: MUST follow:
1. Intro/Goals (15 min)
2. Discovery (~1 hour, customer-led)
3. Custom topics from transcript
4. Lunch (1 hour, for full-day only)
5. More custom topics
6. Next Steps (20-30 min)

**Standard Items** (use these exact descriptions):

**Introductions**:
```
"Brief participant introductions. Overview of session goals and desired outcomes. Logistics and housekeeping."
```

**Discovery**:
```
"Collaborative discovery of [Customer]'s current [domain] environment, processes, and challenges. Focus on understanding pain points, requirements, and business context."
```
Owner: `"Microsoft & Customer"`

**Lunch Break** (full-day only):
```
"Working lunch - informal discussions and Q&A"
```
Owner: `"All"`

**Next Steps**:
```
"Review key takeaways from the session. Define next steps, action items with owners and timelines. Schedule follow-up sessions as needed."
```

**Custom Topics** (transcript-driven):
- Use EXACT phrasing from transcript
- Highly detailed descriptions
- Specific technologies, frameworks, use cases mentioned
- NO generic summaries

## Step 4: Show Preview to User

Before generating JSON, show text preview:

```
PREVIEW: AstraZeneca Copilot Studio Validation
Date: January 20, 2026
Time: 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM

AGENDA:
9:00-9:15 | Introductions & Objectives [Microsoft]
  Brief intros, session goals, logistics

9:15-10:30 | Discovery: Current Copilot Studio Maturity [Microsoft & Customer]
  Deep dive on existing 5,000+ agents, governance challenges with 
  16,500 users, connector approval process, Agent 365 evaluation...

[...remaining items...]

Confirm: Team list, Date/Time, Customer name?
```

## Step 5: Render DOCX (Python Does This)

After user confirms, save JSON and render.

**IMPORTANT**: Before rendering, automatically ensure dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Check and install required packages automatically
# Note: pip will skip packages that are already installed
pip install --quiet docxtpl>=0.16.0 python-docx>=1.1.0 Pillow>=10.0.0
```

Then create the document:

```python
from scripts.core import create_agenda_doc

# Save JSON first
with open('engagement_folder/agenda_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(agenda_data, f, indent=2)

# Render DOCX
template_path = 'assets/agenda_template.docx'
output_path = 'engagement_folder/agenda.docx'

create_agenda_doc(
    data=agenda_data,
    template_path=template_path,
    output_path=output_path,
    logo_path=None  # Optional logo
)
```

**Workflow for rendering**:
1. Use bash tool to install dependencies: `pip install --quiet docxtpl>=0.16.0 python-docx>=1.1.0 Pillow>=10.0.0`
   - Pip automatically skips packages that are already installed and up-to-date
   - The `--quiet` flag minimizes output for a cleaner experience
2. Save the JSON data to a file in the engagement folder
3. Create a Python script that imports from .github/skills/agenda-builder/scripts/core.py
4. Execute the Python script using bash tool to generate the DOCX

This approach ensures the skill "just works" without requiring manual virtual environment setup.

## JSON Schema Details

**Required Fields**:
- `customer` (string): External organization name
- `date` (string): "Month Day, Year" format
- `time` (string): "Start - End" format  
- `title` (string): Specific, concise title
- `summary` (string): Why this session matters
- `primaries` (array): Primary team members
- `supporting` (array): Supporting team members
- `agenda_items` (array): Agenda items with time/owner/topic/description

**Optional Fields**:
- `logo` (string): Path to logo file or base64 image

## Example JSON

See [assets/example_agenda.json](assets/example_agenda.json) for complete example.

## Knowledge Graph Integration

After generating agenda, store topics:

```python
for item in agenda_data['agenda_items']:
    if item['topic'] not in ['Introductions', 'Lunch Break', 'Next Steps']:
        memory:create_entities([{
            "name": item['topic'],
            "entityType": "Topic",
            "observations": [
                f"Description: {item['description']}",
                f"Duration: {calculate_duration(item['time'])}",
                f"Used in {customer} {engagement_type}"
            ]
        }])
```

## Quality Checks (Before Rendering)

Verify:
- [ ] `customer` is external org (NOT "Microsoft")
- [ ] `date` is specific if mentioned in transcript
- [ ] Custom topics have detailed, transcript-specific descriptions
- [ ] Lunch included for full-day sessions (6+ hours)
- [ ] Standard items use standard descriptions
- [ ] Time slots don't overlap
- [ ] Owner is appropriate ("Microsoft", "Microsoft & Customer", "All")

## Common Patterns by Type

**Discovery**:
- 60-90 min customer-led discovery
- Focus on current state, pain points
- More listening than presenting

**Architecture Review**:
- Current architecture overview
- Technical deep-dives with whiteboarding
- Architecture recommendations

**POC Kickoff**:
- Clear success criteria
- Technical requirements
- POC timeline and milestones

**Executive Briefing** (shorter):
- Business value focus
- High-level overview
- Strategic alignment

**Deep Dive**:
- Multiple technical sessions
- Hands-on components
- Detailed action items

## Dependencies

**Automatic Installation**: Dependencies are automatically installed when rendering agendas.

The skill uses these Python packages (versions from `requirements.txt`):
- docxtpl>=0.16.0 (DOCX templating)
- python-docx>=1.1.0 (DOCX manipulation)
- Pillow>=10.0.0 (Image processing)

**No manual setup required** - the skill automatically runs:
```bash
pip install --quiet docxtpl>=0.16.0 python-docx>=1.1.0 Pillow>=10.0.0
```

**Note**: These versions use minimum version requirements (>=) as defined in requirements.txt. This allows compatible updates while maintaining a minimum baseline. Pip automatically skips packages that are already installed and meet the version requirements, making repeated runs efficient.

This ensures the skill "just works" like it does in Claude Desktop, without requiring virtual environment setup.
